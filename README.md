# Yuki's mini app EDIT version 


Based on Yuki's mini ai that he created using tensorflow in shiny. This project greatly inspired me to do one for watson + shiny. 
After which, i decide to make some code changes since I could not run Yuki's shiny app at all. 

# HEADS UP
I have included tensorflow's classify_image.py in here. I did so because it will be easier as my code runs it directly. Not sure if this is actually allowed. If not, do let me know and I will remove. 

# New Features 
Apart from the awesome wordcloud, which i plan to implement in the near future for my own Watson app, I also output the original results in a verbatimtextoutput :D 

# Installation/ usage 
1. Please have python installed in your PC 
2. Simply copy or fork and run. :) 

# Credits 
yuki for the original creation of this 
google for the open source tensorflow. You can found out more via their GitHub

# Future 
Since Yuki stopped, perhaps I might make the app nicer :D
